# Archives

This folder holds documentation that is no longer published on
[docs.gnosischain.com](https://docs.gnosischain.com). Nothing under `archives/` is part of a
Docusaurus content path, so these pages do not build, do not appear in any sidebar, and are not
indexed by search. They are kept in the repository for historical reference only.

Treat every page in here as out of date. Contract addresses, client versions, RPC endpoints and
bridge instructions in archived pages have not been maintained and should not be acted on.

## Archiving a page

1. `git mv` the page (and any images it references) into a folder under `archives/`.
2. Add or update that folder's `README.md` so the page is listed with a one-line reason.
3. Add a redirect in `docusaurus.config.js` from the old route to the nearest live page, so
   inbound links do not 404.
4. Repoint any remaining internal links in `docs/` and `src/` at the live replacement.
