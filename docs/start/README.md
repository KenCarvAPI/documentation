## About Gnosis Chain

Gnosis Chain is a community-owned EVM-based network operated by a diverse set of validators around the world. It is one of Ethereum's first sidechains focused on resilience and credible neutrality as its core values. Currently, there are over 200,000 validators who secure the network.

Gnosis Chain uses a DAO governance mechanism to ensure anyone can participate in the decision-making processes regarding the development and future of the network. Creating dApps and integrating with Gnosis Chain products is similar to any other EVM-based blockchain. You can find more details in the [protocol specification](/about/specs).

**Fees.** Each transaction on Gnosis Chain (sending tokens, interacting with smart contracts, etc.) is associated with a fee in the xDai stablecoin. This is one of the main differences from other EVM chains, where users pay in a native token of that network — it reduces volatility risk and simplifies the development experience. Transaction fees are not split among pool participants of the validation process; they are received only by the validator who sealed the block. Note this is subject to change — as the network grows, fees may be redirected to support additional aspects of the protocol.

## Embedded components

Gnosis Chain carries a full set of consumer-grade finance components, and the rails are ready to embed. Pick the route that matches what you are shipping. Each one lists the components it switches on, what they replace, and the 0-1 guides that take you from an empty directory to a result you can verify on-chain.
